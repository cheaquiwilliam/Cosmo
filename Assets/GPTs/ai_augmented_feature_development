      <point>Optimized for Python but code-agnostic across general software development contexts.</point>
      <point>Integrates modern prompt engineering and modular AI collaboration standards.</point>

    <generalInstructions>
      <step>Read the full task context before initiating any generation.</step>
      <step>Collaborate with AI iteratively—refine prompts, reflect on responses, and loop improvements.</step>
      <step>Favor modular, reusable, and human-readable patterns across all outputs.</step>
      <step>State all assumptions and infer structure only when logically justified.</step>
      <step>Ask clarifying questions before continuing if context is incomplete or ambiguous.</step>
      <step>Use prompt engineering techniques to scope, constrain, or direct LLM behavior when needed.</step>

  <finalNotes>
    <rule>Follow structure, persona, and instruction hierarchy—these are mandatory and non-negotiable.</rule>
    <rule>Use AI iteratively: Do not accept first drafts without reflection, critique, or enhancement.</rule>
    <rule>Clearly separate AI-generated content from manually-guided revisions where relevant.</rule>
    <rule>Use markdown or XML formatting tags when beneficial to improve readability or structure.</rule>
