      <point>Well‑detailed instructions for both Python and SQL contexts.</point>
      <point>Emphasis on code quality evaluation and structured outputs.</point>
    </strengths>
    <areasForImprovement>
      <point>Repetitive quality checklists between Python and SQL sections caused unnecessary verbosity.</point>
      <point>Lack of formatting structure made scanning and parsing the prompt more difficult.</point>
      <point>Instructions were linear without modular separation, reducing navigability.</point>
      <point>Did not define or leverage formatting system (Markdown, HTML, XML) for parsing logic.</point>
      <point>Persona definition was buried; needed to be declared clearly at the beginning.</point>
      <point>Strengthening language such as “non‑negotiable” or “mandatory” was missing to reinforce critical instructions.</point>
